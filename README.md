# Synthetic crack images with GAN
This repository contains experiments with various Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models to generate synthetic crack images. The primary goal of this project is to address the limitations of existing datasets by creating high-quality, realistic crack data that can be used for training and validating machine learning models.
