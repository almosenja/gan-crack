# Synthetic crack images with GAN
This repository contains experiments with various Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models to generate synthetic crack images. The primary goal of this project is to address the limitations of existing datasets by creating high-quality, realistic crack data that can be used for training and validating machine learning models.
 
## DCGAN
DCGAN
DCGAN is a popular GAN architecture that utilizes deep convolutional layers for both the generator and discriminator networks. It was designed to improve the stability of GAN training and produce higher-quality outputs.
